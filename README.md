# Block Biometrics


Block biometrics is a project that incorporates biometric authentication into a security system where there is little trust between users. Our implementation of the system focuses on the scenario of home security. In a home security system, the owner would like to maintain a log of visitors that can not be tampered and would like the visitors to provide proof of their identity. Traditionally users may use a specific account associated with their identity which only they may have access to certain private keys for. These private keys however can easily be lost or potentially be stolen by a clever attacker if storage of the keys is not secure. The most secure way to authenticate this user with the system is to use their biometric data. In summary we want a tamperproof access control system.


To address this concern we have developed an ethereum smart contract based system that makes use of private AI to control user access.
